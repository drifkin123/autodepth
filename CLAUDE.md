# CLAUDE.md — AutoDepth Project Brief

## What This App Is

**AutoDepth** is a personal car market intelligence dashboard for enthusiasts tracking performance and exotic cars. It aggregates real vehicle sales data from auctions, dealerships, and listing platforms, models depreciation curves, and helps users decide *when* to buy the car they want at the best possible price.

Target cars: Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren, Audi (R8, RS models), Mercedes-AMG GT, Corvette C8 Z06, Lotus, and similar performance/exotic vehicles from the last 20 years.

This is a solo developer project. Prioritize clarity, maintainability, and shipping over abstraction and over-engineering.

## Key Features & Pages

### 1. Garage (Watchlist Dashboard) — `/`
- Grid of watched cars with current estimated value, delta from when added, and buy window indicator
- "Buy window" badge: 🔴 Depreciating fast / 🟡 Near floor / 🟢 At floor / ⬆️ Appreciating
- Quick-add search to add a car to the garage

### 2. Car Deep-Dive — `/cars/:id`
- Hero: make/model/trim, production count, engine type, original MSRP
- Price history chart (all auction results plotted, with trend line overlay)
- Depreciation curve with forward prediction (confidence band shaded)
- "Best time to buy" callout with plain-English explanation
- Recent sales/listings table (price, mileage, color, source type, date, link to source)
- Key insights panel: e.g. "This is a naturally aspirated Ferrari — values are rising, not falling"

### 3. Compare — `/compare`
- Select 2–4 cars from search
- Overlaid depreciation curves on a single chart (each car a different color)
- Side-by-side stats table: current avg price, 1yr change, 3yr projection, production count, rarity score
- "Which is the better buy right now?" AI-generated summary (call Claude API)

### 4. Market — `/market`
- Recent notable auction results across all tracked cars
- Trending: biggest movers this month (up and down)
- "On the radar" — cars approaching their predicted price floor

## Depreciation Model (Python — `services/depreciation.py`)

Use a curve-fitting approach on the auction sales data:

1. **Data prep**: filter `vehicle_sales` by `car_id`; use `sold_price` (confirmed sales only) as the primary input for curve fitting; `asking_price` from listing sources can inform a separate "market ask" overlay but must never be mixed into the depreciation model directly — asking and sold prices diverge significantly and conflating them will skew the curve. Normalize mileage (use age if mileage unavailable), remove outliers (>2 std dev from monthly mean).
2. **Curve fitting**: fit an exponential decay curve `P(t) = P0 * e^(-λt) + C` where C is the floor price
3. **Floor detection**: C is estimated as a percentage of original MSRP, adjusted for:
   - Production scarcity (lower production count → higher floor)
   - Natural aspiration premium (add 15–25% floor multiplier for NA exotics)
   - Current market trend (trailing 6-month slope)
4. **Forward projection**: extend curve 36 months, generate confidence band (±1 std dev of residuals)
5. **Buy window**: flag the predicted date when the curve slope flattens (d²P/dt² ≈ 0) as "optimal buy"

Store predictions in `price_predictions` table. Re-run model nightly after scrape.

---

## Scrapers (Python — `scrapers/`)

All scrapers use Playwright (async), share a common base interface, and write into `vehicle_sales`. Each scraper is its own file under `scrapers/`.

**Data hierarchy — important:**
Confirmed auction sale prices are ground truth for the depreciation model. Dealer/listing asking prices are secondary signal only (never mixed into curve fitting). Prioritize auction sources.

**Why no AutoTrader:** AutoTrader runs behind Cloudflare with aggressive bot detection. Scraping it reliably requires paid residential proxies and is not worth the fragility for data that is secondary signal anyway. **MarketCheck API was also evaluated and rejected** — it does not cover BaT/C&B/RM auction data at all, its "sold" data is just dealer listings going dark (no confirmed prices), and the free tier is limited to a 100-mile radius. Not suitable for national exotic car market tracking.

**Common contract for all scrapers:**
- Deduplicate on `source_url` before inserting
- Set `sale_type` and `is_sold` appropriately per source
- Match to `cars` table via fuzzy make/model/trim matching
- Log all scrape runs to a `scrape_logs` table (start time, source, records found, records inserted, errors)
- Run on a schedule: nightly at 2am UTC via Railway cron job

**Sources (priority order):**

| File | Source | Type | Data value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bring_a_trailer.py` | Bring a Trailer | auction | ⭐⭐⭐ Confirmed hammer prices — primary model input |
| `cars_and_bids.py` | Cars & Bids | auction | ⭐⭐⭐ Confirmed hammer prices — primary model input |
| `rm_sothebys.py` | RM Sotheby's | auction | ⭐⭐⭐ High-end confirmed sales — primary model input |
| `cars_com.py` | Cars.com | listing | ⭐ Asking prices only; `sold_price=NULL`, `is_sold=false`; secondary signal |

**Extract fields (all sources):** price/bid, year, mileage, title (parse make/model/trim), date, listing URL, color (if available), condition notes (if available).

## Git Workflow

- Work on a new branch for each build order step: `step/1-monorepo-setup`, `step/2-database-migrations`, etc.
- When a step is complete and approved, commit with a conventional commit message summarizing what was built
- Open a PR to main with a short description of the step and any decisions made
- Do not move to the next step until the PR is merged or explicitly approved

---

## Code Conventions

- **Python**: type hints everywhere, async/await throughout, Pydantic v2 for request/response schemas
- **TypeScript**: strict mode on, no `any`, all API responses typed via `packages/shared/types.ts`
- **Components**: functional only, no class components
- **Styling (web)**: Tailwind CSS — dark theme by default, accent color `#E8D5A3` (warm gold)
- **Error handling**: all API calls wrapped in try/catch, errors surfaced to user via toast notifications
- **Env vars**: never hardcode secrets. All secrets via `.env` (backend) and Vite's `VITE_` prefix (frontend). See `.env.example`.
- **Git**: conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `data:` for seed/migration changes)

---

## Design Direction

**Aesthetic**: Dark, refined, automotive. Think car configurator meets Bloomberg terminal.
- Background: near-black `#0A0A0A`
- Surface: `#141414` cards
- Accent: warm gold `#E8D5A3` for highlights, CTAs, and key data points
- Text: `#F5F5F5` primary, `#888` secondary
- Charts: multi-color with high contrast against dark background
- Typography: something with character — not Inter. Consider Geist, DM Sans, or a sharp grotesque.
- Motion: subtle. Chart lines animate in on load. Cards fade up on entry. No gratuitous animation.

The app should feel like it was built by someone who actually loves cars, not a generic SaaS dashboard.

## Build Order (Follow This Sequence)

1. **Repo + tooling setup**: monorepo scaffold, pnpm workspaces, shared types package, docker-compose for local Postgres+TimescaleDB
2. **Database + migrations**: all core tables, Alembic setup, seed the `cars` catalog
3. **BaT scraper**: Playwright scraper → parse → insert into `auction_sales`. Verify real data flowing.
4. **Depreciation model**: curve fitting service, populate `price_predictions`, write unit tests
5. **FastAPI backend**: all API routes, Clerk JWT middleware, connect to DB
6. **Web frontend**: Vite + React scaffold, Tailwind dark theme, Clerk auth, API client
7. **Garage page**: watchlist UI, buy window badges
8. **Car deep-dive page**: price history chart, depreciation curve, recent sales table
9. **Compare page**: multi-car chart overlay, stats table, Claude API summary
10. **Market page**: recent auctions feed, trending movers
11. **Expo mobile app**: port core pages using Expo Router, Victory Native charts
12. **Deploy**: Railway (backend), Vercel (web), Expo EAS (mobile)

## What Success Looks Like (MVP)

A logged-in user can:
- Search for any tracked car and add it to their garage
- See a real price history chart backed by actual BaT auction data
- See a depreciation curve with a projected buy window
- Compare 2–4 cars side by side on overlaid curves
- View recent auction results with links to the original listings
- Get a plain-English "should I buy now or wait?" summary on the compare page
